## About the Curationist Project

An initiative of the [MHz Foundation](https://www.mhzfoundation.org/), 
the [Curationist platform](https://www.curationist.org/about-us/) aims to become an ecosystem for collecting and sharing
cultural materials from the Creative Commons and public domain. It brings together artworks from multiple museums and cultural
institutions worldwide that release their collections through an open data policy. Artwork metadata and associated media files
are harvested through open <span class="tooltip">APIs<span class="tooltiptext">Application Programming Interface, a way
    for computer programs to talk to each other.</span></span>
and bulk data delivery. Once collected, this data is mapped from the particular information schema used by each source to the
Curationist data model, indexed and exposed to a powerful search interface that enables users to create collections and contribute
their own metadata, e.g. by suggesting alternate classification terms, translating, correcting errors, etc.

## Technical project management

My first role on this project was as Technical Project Manager, where I was responsible for coordinating a distributed team of
front-end and back-end developers, software architects, consultants and stakeholders. 
I worked closely with the product owner to define functional 
requirements, discussing potential technical solutions with developers and the software architect and following up on development
tasks delegated to multiple developers on several time zones.

## Metadata consulting and quality assurance

As the project progressed, my role evolved to focus more on metadata harvesting and mapping. This involves evaluating new data sources,
navigating technical and licensing conditions for adding them to the Curationist database. Once the metadata schema of a new source
is mapped to the Curationist internal format, I work with developers to ensure it is being properly harvested and mapped and
provide Quality Assurance for each source.
