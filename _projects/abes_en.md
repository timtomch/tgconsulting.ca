Among the services managed by [Agence bibliographique de l’enseignement supérieur](https://abes.fr/) (Abes) is France's higher
education union catalogue [Sudoc](http://www.sudoc.abes.fr). With its 15 million bibliographic records and 50 million items
from more than 3,500 academic and research libraries, it receives more than 4 million visits per year from public users and
library professionals alike. 

Aiming to modernize the Sudoc's web interface, Abes mandated [arbim IT](https://arbim.ch/projets/evolution-de-sudoc-fr/) 
in the Spring of 2022 to do a market analysis and identify pertinent technical solutions for its evolution. I had the opportunity
to collaborate with arbim IT for this project.
