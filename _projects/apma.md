This project aimed to make a collection of 100 Canadian-authored, Atlantic Canadian-published ebooks (65 English and 35 French) 
with accessibility features more visible, discoverable and available to public library users in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
The pilot collection included titles from all APMA member publishers and were selected among content produced according to the 
National Network for Equitable Library Service's 
[best practices for publishers](https://www.accessiblepublishing.ca/resources-for-publishers/).

Another requirement of the project was to use library ebook platforms (Overdrive and pretnumerique.ca) already in use by the
participating libraries and established distribution channels to increase visibility and reduce overhead both for participating
libraries and publishers. Titles in the pilot collection were made available for an unlimited number of concurrent uses and for
the duration of the pilot to explore alternative licensing terms for library ebooks.
