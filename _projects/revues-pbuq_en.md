The publication of research results in peer-reviewed journals is an established way of spreading scholarly output.
While many journals are nowadays edited by large, for-profit publishers, there remains a significant number of independent
journals, several of which are being edited by learned societies or similar organizations based at Quebec universities.
Such independant journals, and in particular those in so-called "diamond" open-access (operated at no costs to both authors and readers)
[play a particularly important role in the wide diffusion of knowledge](https://zenodo.org/record/4558704).

Aware of the importance of independant journals, university libraries in Quebec have developed hosting and support services dedicated
to this ecosystem of open and mostly francophone publications, centered around the [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/) software.

I was mandated by the [Partenariat des Bibliothèques Universitaires du Québec](https://www.biblios-uni-qc.org/)
to conduct a busines analysis of current journal support services as well as scenarios for their development and consortial operation opportunities
on the provincial scale.
