The [Iter Bibliography](https://iterpress.org/databases/) is a curated database
of secondary source material pertaining to the Middle Ages and Renaissance with over 1.5 milion entries.

In this project, I advised the Iter team on the migration of the bibliography from end-of-life software to a sustainable, hosted solution.

I compared available solutions able to provide required features, requested proposals from vendors and hosting providers, analyzed costs and benefits and
prepared a recommendation to the client.
