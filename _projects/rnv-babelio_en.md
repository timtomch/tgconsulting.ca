[The Renouvaud network](https://www.bcu-lausanne.ch/en/reseau-renouvaud/) includes 
[over 150 academic, research, school and public libraries](https://map.renouvaud.ch/) in Vaud, Switzerland. Their public catalogue
runs on shared instances of the ExLibris Alma/Primo library services platform.

[Babelio](https://www.babelio.com/) is a platform used by 1.8 milion users to share reader reviews, ratings and citations.
This data can be used to enrich library catalogues through the [Babelth√®que](https://www.babelio.com/article/2065/babeltheque)
service.

I developed a custom Primo module for integrating data from the Babelio API on the Renouvaud catalogue for public and school libraries.
The resulting code is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/timtomch/rnv-babelio-primo).

The module was developed using [a local development environment](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-devenv),
before being tested in a sandbox and deployed to production.
